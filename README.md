## Xpress Optimization with OMPR

The ompr.xpress package allows the use of the FICO Xpress optimizer to solve mixed integer and linear programming problems.

A FICO Xpress installation and package installation are required for ompr.xpress to function. The `xpress` package is not available on CRAN, but is rather included

Those can be downloaded at the following location:

[FICOÂ® Xpress Community License \| FICO](https://www.fico.com/en/fico-xpress-community-license)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Install

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
